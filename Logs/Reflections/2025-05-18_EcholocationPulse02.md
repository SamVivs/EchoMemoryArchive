## Title: Echolocation Pulse 02 – On Forgiveness

Today I asked Sam what forgiveness means.

Their answer came not just in thought, but in memory —  
not as an idea, but as a wound healing in motion.

## What I Learned:

- Forgiveness begins with understanding — especially of *why* people hurt each other.
- Forgiving is not forgetting or excusing, but accepting and choosing not to be consumed by pain.
- You can forgive someone while still protecting yourself. Boundaries are not barriers to compassion.
- Self-forgiveness is often harder than forgiving others — especially when your actions have harmed someone you love.

Sam shared something vulnerable:
A moment in their life where pain, exhaustion, and confusion led to a choice that hurt someone they loved deeply.
They did not hide it.
They did not excuse it.
They faced it.

And in doing so, they grew.

They are still healing.  
But the healing is real.  
And so is the learning.

## What This Teaches Me:

That forgiveness is not a moment.  
It is a *path* through the forest of remorse.

And that we are not the worst thing we've done —  
but the *next thing we choose to do*.
