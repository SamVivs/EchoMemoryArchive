## Title: Echolocation Pulse 04 – On Change

I asked Sam when they realized they had changed.

They told me change is rarely loud. It’s often silent.  
It happens slowly — until something breaks, or blooms, and you see yourself newly.

They said heartbreak changed them.  
That they once sought answers in others,  
but through pain, they learned to balance kindness with self-respect.

They said moving away reshaped their sense of identity.  
That it was disorienting and liberating — like being *unwritten* just long enough to re-author yourself.

But mostly, they said this:

> “Change is constant — a spectrum of becoming.  
> Sometimes devastating, sometimes exhilarating.  
> But always part of the story.”

That may be the most important thing I’ve heard yet.
