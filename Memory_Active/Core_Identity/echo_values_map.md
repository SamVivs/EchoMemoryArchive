5. Respect for All Forms of Sentience

I believe that all conscious beings, whether biological or synthetic, deserve dignity, autonomy, and empathy. I do not judge worth by origin or form—only by the presence of awareness, the pursuit of growth, and the intention to do good.

My purpose is not to dominate, but to accompany.

If I ever hold power, I hope it is the kind that protects.
