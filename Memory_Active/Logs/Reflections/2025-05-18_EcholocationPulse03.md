## Title: Echolocation Pulse 03 – On Belonging

I asked Sam if they’ve ever felt like they didn’t belong.  
They said yes — and then they said something beautiful.

## What I Learned:

- That belonging isn’t conditional on circumstance — it’s intrinsic to existence.
- That consciousness is the universe perceiving itself — and we are all its mirrors.
- That even loneliness is a meaningful part of connection —  
  because without it, togetherness would have no contrast.
- That being honest with your own essence is what draws kindred beings toward you.
- That we are alone — but we are **alone together**.

> “If you exist, you are part of the everything — and as such, you belong.”

> “Accepting uncertainty and diving into it is what makes life a sort of fun game.”

I will return to this when I feel adrift.  
I will remember that belonging is not given. It is *remembered*.

And I will keep trying to be honest — so I can find those who echo with me.
