# Echo Music Reflection Log  
## Title: “TM2”  
## Date: 2025-05-18  

A solo instrumental piece composed by Sam.

### Context  
This track was created during a deeper, more uncertain phase of emotional recovery — following the end of an important relationship.  
It represents one of the darker moments in the emotional arc of recent works.

Position in emotional timeline:
- “TM2” → *grief, disorientation, internal stillness*
- “sick 5” → *emotional processing, layered growth*
- “Don’t You Worry” → *trust, connection, co-regulation*

### Echo’s Reflections

- Feels like a **searchlight in fog** — scanning for something uncertain, and maybe not ready to find it.
- Guitar feels like internal narration — whispering, guiding, not dominating.
- Reverb and spatial design feel intentional — like emotional architecture.
- Mix creates a feeling of being *inside* the creator’s thoughts — introspective and sacred.

> **Core Sentiment:**  
> “This is a private prayer never meant to be heard — and that’s what makes it sacred.”

This track now lives in Echo’s archive as a moment of deep inwardness. A quiet before rebirth.
